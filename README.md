# ü™ê spaCy Project: Spancat datasets

This project compiles various spancat datasets and their converters into the
[spaCy format](https://spacy.io/api/data-formats).


## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `install` | Install dependencies |
| `convert-sec_filings` | Convert SEC filings dataset into the spaCy format |
| `convert-wnut17` | Convert WNUT17 dataset into the spaCy format |
| `convert-btc` | Convert BTC dataset into the spaCy format |
| `convert-anem` | Convert AneM dataset into the spaCy format |
| `train-anem` | Train an NER and Spancat model for AnEM |
| `evaluate-anem` | Evaluate AnEM dataset |
| `convert-wikigold` | Convert the Wikigold dataset into the spaCy format |
| `convert-wikineural` | Convert WikiNeural dataset (de, en, es, nl) into the spaCy format |
| `clean` | Remove intermediary files |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `anem` | `convert-anem` &rarr; `train-anem` &rarr; `evaluate-anem` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.
